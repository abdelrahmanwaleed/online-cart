# Online Store with React and Redux

This project is a modern online store application built using React and Redux. It features a product catalog fetched from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/products), a shopping cart with persistent storage, and user notifications.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Display products fetched from an external API.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add products to the cart, view cart contents, and remove items.
- **Persistent Storage**: Cart data is saved to and loaded from local storage.
- **Notifications**: Toast notifications for product addition to the cart.
- **Clear Cart**: Option to clear all items from the cart.

## Usage

### Adding Products to the Cart

1. **Navigate to the product listing page**.
2. **Click on the "Add to Cart" button** for any product.
3. **A toast notification** will appear confirming the product has been added to the cart.

### Viewing and Managing the Cart

1. **Navigate to the cart page** by clicking on the "Cart" link in the navigation bar.
2. **The cart page** will display all added products with their quantities.
3. **Remove individual items** by clicking the "Remove" button next to each product.
4. **To remove all items from the cart**, click the "Clear Cart" button.

## Dependencies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A state management library for JavaScript applications.
- **React-Redux**: Official React bindings for Redux.
- **Redux Toolkit**: The official, recommended way to write Redux logic.
- **React-Toastify**: A library for displaying toast notifications.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

## Configuration

The project uses Redux for state management, and Redux Toolkit for simplifying the Redux setup. The cart data is persisted in the browserâ€™s local storage to maintain the cart state across page reloads.

### Redux Setup

- **Store**: Configured in `src/redux/store.js`.
- **Cart Slice**: Manages cart state and actions in `src/redux/cartSlice.js`.

### API Integration

Products are fetched from [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/products) using Axios.

## Troubleshooting

- **Cart Not Persisting**: Ensure that local storage is accessible and not blocked by browser settings.
- **Toast Notifications Not Displaying**: Verify that `react-toastify` is correctly installed and imported in the project.
